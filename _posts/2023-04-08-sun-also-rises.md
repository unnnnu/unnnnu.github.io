title: The Sun also rises
---
I have been wanting to post on this website for a very long time but the question about what I want it to be like comes in the way. There is nothing in my life that I consider as my holy grail. My life is rather a collection of a lot of things that I love and enjoy. I do not want my life to be a series of _nothings_, but a medley of many _things_.

So on _unnu.so_, I have _so_ many things, some unfinished like the book 'The Sun also rises' and some that I keep going back to again and again. I will try my best to keep them organized and easy to navigate. But like my life, I expect it to be chaotic. So chaotic.
