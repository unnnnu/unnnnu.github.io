Hello there!

My name is Unnati, but you can call me Unnu. I'm a UX researcher with a background in psychology to thank for my love of exploring biases and cognitive principles. I am a part of [UCC (User Connect Consultancy)](https://www.userconnectconsultancy.com/), which is a group of passionate user researchers who are deeply committed to user-centricity. When I'm not synthesising information from interviews, you can find me cracking (admittedly) terrible jokes or working on a new obsession (currently cubing). I stand for inclusive workspaces for neurodivergent individuals and I am super excited to meet you all! :)
