   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to post on this website for a very long time but the question about what I want it to be like comes in the way. There is nothing in my life that I consider as my holy grail. My life is rather a collection of a lot of things that I love and enjoy. I do not want my life to be a series of &lt;em&gt;nothings&lt;/em&gt;, but a medley of many &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on &lt;em&gt;unnu.so&lt;/em&gt;, I have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many things, some unfinished like the book ‘The Sun also rises’ and some that I keep going back to again and again. I will try my best to keep them organized and easy to navigate. But like my life, I expect it to be chaotic. So chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
